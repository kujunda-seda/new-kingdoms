# Welcome to the New&nbsp;Kingdoms
_a game engine for coders._

![New Kingdoms Logo](../../assets/images/new-kingdoms-logo.png){: width="96" }

The main benefit of the New Kingdoms is not the code itself, but a readily implemented concept of decoupled and independently programmed object behaviours and their (optional) presentation. The code sets the minimal required interaction between the game layers, that bring those objects to life in a sandboxed universe.

Please explore the concept by navigating this site, and head to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kujunda-seda/new-kingdoms) to get the engine sources.
