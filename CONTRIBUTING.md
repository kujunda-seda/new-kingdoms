Thank you for your interest in contributing to New Kingdoms! We value your effort and time,
please read this before filing an issue or a PR. 

## Filing issues

Before filing an issue, please consider New Kingdoms' key differentiators that define its roadmap:
- Decoupled logic and presentation: behaviors are coded independently, simulations can run in CLI
- Presetless and unrestricted by a predefined game type
- For those who like to code
- Lightweight, not a dependency, fast to run
- Self-explanatory code, less abstractions
- A simulator of real-world objects, that live their own lives inside the game by the defined rules.

Issues not related to those areas will be closed as unplanned, but are encouraged if they provide strong reasoning to pursue.

## Code contributions

New Kingdoms is developed for in-house games and is dedicated to public domain. To prevent legal issues, no external contributions will be accepted. If you still plan to create PRs, please include public domain dedication in the description and be sure not to include any copyrighted material (including your own) with it.

Contributions not adhering to the rules above will be dismissed.
